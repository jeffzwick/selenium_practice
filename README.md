# selenium_practice

Testing my selenium with Python skills on a practice webpage
after completing Udemy course "Selenium WebDriver with Python" course.

Most of the framework was constructed as we went along in the class.
The following folders contain files created in class (some methods 
have been added by me over time):
- "practice_site\base"
- "practice_site\utilities"

I created the following folders, and the files within:
- "practice_site\pages"
- "practice_site\tests"

Tests are run against https://www.seleniumeasy.com/test/
This site was not covered in class.

After running a test, a file is created (automation.log) and added
to the tests directory. I have added an example of the log printout. 

Any failed tests will take a screenshot and add it to a screenshot 
directory within the practice_site directory.

Some tests fail or could not be completed due to bugs on the site.
These bugs were found with my tests...woo hoo!

I will continue to add/edit tests as I have time.
