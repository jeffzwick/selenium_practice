# selenium_practice

Testing my selenium with Python skills on a practice webpage
after completing Udemy course "Selenium WebDriver with Python" course.

Most of the framework was constructed as we went along in the class.

I created all of the tests in "practice_site\tests\elements" folder and
utilized the framework, tweaking it where needed.

Tests are run against https://www.seleniumeasy.com/test/
This site was not covered in class.

Some tests fail or could not be completed due to bugs on the site.
These bugs were found with my tests...woo hoo!

I will continue to add/edit tests as I have time.
